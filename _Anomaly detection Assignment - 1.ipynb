    "In many real-world scenarios, anomalies are rare compared to normal instances, leading to imbalanced datasets. This imbalance can make it difficult for models to accurately detect anomalies without being overwhelmed by the majority class.\n",

    "Anomaly detection often requires labeled data for model training, but obtaining labeled anomalies can be expensive or impractical in many cases. This leads to the need for unsupervised or semi-supervised anomaly detection techniques.\n",

    "Distance-based methods assume that anomalies are typically isolated or distant from normal instances in the data space. In other words, anomalies are expected to have significantly different characteristics or properties compared to normal data points.\n",

    "##### 3.Uniform density: \n",
    "Distance-based methods often assume that the density of normal instances is approximately uniform throughout the data space. Anomalies are then identified as data points that fall outside regions of high density.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 4.Euclidean distance:\n",
    "Many distance-based methods, such as k-nearest neighbors (KNN) and DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise), rely on the Euclidean distance metric to measure the similarity or dissimilarity between data points. These methods assume that distances accurately reflect the similarity between instances in the data space.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 5.Fixed neighborhood size:\n",
    "Some distance-based methods, like KNN, assume a fixed neighborhood size for defining the local environment of each data point. Anomalies are identified based on their distance from neighboring points within this fixed radius.\n",

    "It's important to note that these assumptions may not always hold true in real-world datasets, and the effectiveness of distance-based anomaly detection methods can be influenced by factors such as the distribution of the data, the dimensionality of the feature space, and the presence of noise or outliers. As such, careful consideration and evaluation are required when applying distance-based methods to different types of data and anomaly detection tasks."

Points with significantly lower local densities compared to their neighbors are assigned higher anomaly scores, indicating that they are more likely to be anomalies."
